A matching game

The purpose of this game is to match 3 uncovered cards.

If you get stuck, press 'R' to re-shuffle the remaining cards.

Click on the card on the bottom of a column to select.

To use the keyboard, instead, press left arrow key and right arrow key to move between cards and space to select.

You can chose a difficulty level (1 to 4) by passing the -level=# option. The default level is 3.
